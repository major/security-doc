Unsafe Environment Handling in MuranoPL
---

### Summary ###
The Murano service's MuranoPL extension to the YAQL language fails
to sanitize the supplied environment, leading to potential leakage
of sensitive service account information. Murano is an inactive
project, so no fix is currently under development for this
vulnerability. It is strongly recommended that any OpenStack
deployments disable or fully remove Murano, if installed, at the
earliest opportunity.

### Affected Services / Software ###
- murano: all versions

### Discussion ###
The YAQL interpreter project has released a new major version
(3.0.0) which removes support for format strings, a feature
necessary to exploit this condition in MuranoPL. Because Murano is
not considered under active maintenance in OpenStack, its complete
removal from all deployments is still strongly advised.

Note that this behavior change in YAQL means configurations relying
on string formatting will no longer be interpreted the same after
upgrading, which could cause them to not work as intended by their
users in services which accept YAQL (including Heat and Mistral).
Reliance on that feature is considered to be unusual, but users
should be made aware in case it negatively impacts their
configuration.

### Recommended Actions ###
Disable the Murano service in, or fully remove it from, all
OpenStack deployments at the earliest opportunity.
