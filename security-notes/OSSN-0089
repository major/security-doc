Missing configuration option in Secure Live Migration guide leads to
unencrypted traffic
---

### Summary ###
The guide to enable secure live migration with QEMU-native tls on nova compute
nodes missed an important config option. Without this option a hard-coded part
in nova is triggerd which sets the default route to TCP instead of TLS. This
leads to an unecrypted migration of the ram without throwing any kind of Error.

### Affected Services / Software ###
Nova / Victoria, Ussuri, Train, Stein
(might also be affected: Rocky, Queens, Pike, Ocata)

### Discussion ###
In the OpenStack guide to setup secure live migration with QEMU-native tls
there are a few configuration options given, which have to be applied to nova
compute nodes. After following the instructions and setting up everything it
seems to work as expected. But after checking that libvirt is able to use tls
using tcpdump to listen on the port for tls while manually executing libvirt
commands, the same check for live migration of an instance through openstack
fails. Listening on the port for unencrypted tcp-traffic shows that OpenStack
still uses the unencrypted TCP path instead of the TLS one for the migration.

The reason for this is a patch from Ocata which adds the calculation of the
live-migration-uri in code:
https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/nova/+/410817/
The config parameter ``live_migration_uri`` was deprecated in favor of
``live_migration_scheme`` and the default set to tcp. This leads to the
problem that if none of these two config options are set, libvirt will
always use the default tcp connection. To enable QEMU-native TLS to be used in
nova one of them has to be set so that a TLS connection can be established.
Currently the guide does not show that this is necessary and there was no
other documentation indicating that these config options are important for the
usage of QEMU-native TLS.

As there is no documentation which recognizes this and it is hard to find this
problem as the migration happens even without those config option set - not
stating that it is still unencrypted, it might have been unrecognized in
various deployments, which followed the guide.

### Recommended Actions ###
For deployments using secure live migration with QEMU-native TLS:

1. Check the config of all nova compute nodes. The ``libvirt`` section needs
to have either ``live_migration_uri`` (deprecated) or
``live_migration_scheme`` configured.

2. If neither of those config options are present, add
``live_migration_scheme = tls`` to enable the use of the tls connection.

#### Patches ####
The guide for secure live migration was updated to reflect the necessary
configuration options and now has a note, which warns users that not setting
all config options may lead into a seemingly working deployment, which still
uses unencrypted traffic for the ram-migration.
