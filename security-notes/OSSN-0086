Dell EMC ScaleIO/VxFlex OS Backend Credentials Exposure
---

### Summary ###
This vulnerability is present when using Cinder with a Dell EMC
ScaleIO or VxFlex OS storage backend.

Note: The Dell EMC "ScaleIO" driver was rebranded as "VxFlex OS" in
the Train release.

### Affected Services / Software ###
Cinder / Ocata, Pike, Queens, Rocky, Stein, Train, Ussuri

This vulnerability applies only when using a Dell EMC ScaleIO/VxFlex
OS Backend with Cinder.  Other drivers are not impacted.

### Discussion ###
When using Cinder with the Dell EMC ScaleIO or VxFlex OS backend
storage driver, credentials for the entire backend are exposed in the
``connection_info`` element in all Block Storage v3 Attachments API
calls containing that element.  This enables an end user to create a
volume, make an API call to show the attachment detail information,
and retrieve a username and password that may be used to connect to
another user's volume.  Additionally, these credentials are valid for
the ScaleIO or VxFlex OS Management API, should an attacker discover
the Management API endpoint.

This issue was reported by David Hill and Eric Harney of Red Hat.

### Recommended Actions ###
Remediation of this issue consists of the following:

1. Patching the ScaleIO or VxFlex OS Cinder driver so that it no
   longer provides the password to Cinder when a Block Storage v3
   Attachments API response is constructed.

2. Patching the ScaleIO connector in the os-brick library so that it
   retrieves the password from a configuration file readable only by
   root.  (Note: the connector was not rebranded; both ScaleIO and
   VxFlex OS backends use the 'scaleio' os-brick connector.)

3. Patching the ScaleIO os-brick privileged file that allows the
   scaleio connector to escalate privileges for specific operations;
   this is necessary to allow the connector process to access the
   configuration file that is readable only by root.

4. Deploying a configuration file containing the password (and
   replication password, if applicable) to all compute nodes, cinder
   nodes, and anywhere you would perform a volume attachment in your
   deployment.

To refresh database information, all volumes should be detached and
reattached.

Because this remediation consists of deploying credentials in a
root-readable-only file, it is not suitable for the use case of
attaching a volume to a bare metal host.  Thus, the Dell EMC
ScaleIO/VxFlex OS storage backend for Cinder is *not recommended*
for use with bare metal hosts.

Note: The Ocata, Pike, Queens, and Rocky branches of OpenStack are in
the Extended Maintenance phase.  Point releases are no longer made
from these branches and security patches are produced only on a
reasonable effort basis.  Patches for Queens and Rocky are provided as
a courtesy.  Patches for Ocata and Pike are not available.

#### Patches ####

Both cinder and os-brick must be patched.  Documentation is provided
as part of the cinder patch concerning the new configuration file that
must be deployed to all compute nodes, cinder nodes, and anywhere you
would perform a volume attachment in your deployment.

NOTE (added 2020-06-18): The original patch for os-brick contained
a flaw [0] that prevented the scaleio connector from operating when run
under Python 2.7.  Thus for OpenStack releases supporting Python 2.7
(that is, Train and earlier), a second os-brick patch is required and
is listed below.  The list of available releases has also been updated
to address this issue.
