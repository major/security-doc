BMC emulators developed in OpenStack community do not preserve passwords on VMs
---

### Summary ###
When deploying VirtualBMC or Sushy-Tools in an unsupported, production-like
configuration, it can remove secret data, including VNC passwords, from a
libvirt domain permanently. Operators impacted by this vulnerability must
reconfigure any secret data, including VNC passwords, for the libvirt domain.

These virtual machine emulators are tools to help emulate a physical machine's
Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) to aid in development and testing of
software that would otherwise require physical machines to perform integration
testing activities. They are not intended or supported for production or
long-term use of any kind.

### Affected Services / Software ###
- Sushy-Tools, <=0.21.0
- VirtualBMC, <=2.2.2

There is no impact to any OpenStack software or services intended for
production use.

### Discussion ###
To perform some advanced operations on Libvirt virtual machines, the underlying
XML document describing the virtual machine's domain must be extracted,
modified, and then updated. These specific actions are for aspects such as
"setting a boot device" (VirtualBMC, Sushy-Tools), Setting a boot mode
(Sushy-Tools), and setting a virtual media device (Sushy-Tools).

This issue is triggered when a VM has any kind of "secure" information defined
in the XML domain definition. If an operator deploys VirtualBMC or Sushy-Tools
to manage one of these libvirt VMs, the first time any action is performed that
requires rewriting of the XML domain definition, all secure information --
including a VNC console password, if set -- is lost and removed from the domain
definition, leaving the libvirt VM's exposed to a malicious console user.

### Recommended Actions ###
Operators who may have been impacted by this vulnerability should immediately
remove use of VirtualBMC and/or Sushy-Tools from their production environment.
Then, validate and if necessary, reconfigure passwords for VNC access or any
other impacted secrets.
