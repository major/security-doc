Database back end considerations
================================

PostgreSQL has a number of desirable security features such as Kerberos
authentication, object-level security, and encryption support. The
PostgreSQL community has done well to provide solid guidance,
documentation, and tooling to promote positive security practices.

MySQL has a large community, widespread adoption, and provides high
availability options. MySQL also has the ability to provide enhanced
client authentication by way of plug-in authentication mechanisms.
Forked distributions in the MySQL community provide many options for
consideration. It is important to choose a specific implementation of
MySQL based on a thorough evaluation of the security posture and the
level of support provided for the given distribution.
